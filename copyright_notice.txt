Mappapp and all of my code is released for use under the MIT software license as stated
in the LICENSE file pertaining to mappapp. I have used many amazing code libraries in 
creating this program, all of which are under similar open source licenses but I still
want to say that I am respecting their copyrights and respective licensing and ask that
anyone using or looking at this application do the same. (see the relavent lisence files)

My one ask and note is that the tileset images I have drawn for this project are NOT to
be used for commercial purposes without explicit permission from me.
